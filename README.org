* About

[[file:./docs/images/elements.png]]

The *Relational Algebra Engine* implements relational algebra in its
strict, theoretical form, adhering rigorously to the principles of
relational theory as articulated by E. F. Codd.

A *relation* is modeled as a set of tuples, each tuple being a set
of attributes. Each attribute is a pairing of a name with a value
drawn from a domain. All operations are defined on *entire relations
as sets*, with no recourse to the compromises typical of SQL or other
practical implementations.

The engine is intended as a *study in correctness*: each operation,
from projection to join, is executed in a manner consistent with the
classical definition of relational algebra. It is a platform for
exploring the consequences of relational theory in a low-level
programming context, providing both a tool for experimentation and a
concrete realization of the abstract model.
